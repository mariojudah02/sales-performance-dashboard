## Business Context
This dataset represents transactional sales data of an e-commerce company operating across multiple U.S. states and cities.
Each record corresponds to a sales transaction containing information about order details, product categories, customers, payment methods, geographic location, order dates, and financial metrics such as revenue and profit.

The dataset does not contain product-level identifiers (SKU). Therefore, the analysis is conducted at the product category and sub-category level, which reflects aggregated product reporting commonly used in executive dashboards.

The data spans multiple years and enables analysis of sales performance over time, customer purchasing behavior, category-level performance, and early signals of customer churn.
The project simulates a real-world business intelligence scenario where raw transactional data is transformed into a structured analytical model (star schema) to support decision-making through dashboards and KPIs.

## Business Questions
The objective of this analysis is to answer key business questions relevant to sales performance monitoring and strategic decision-making:

### Sales Performance Over Time
- How does total revenue evolve month-over-month (MoM)?
- Are there visible growth or decline trends in specific periods?

### Category Performance
- Which product categories and sub-categories generate the highest revenue?
- Which categories/sub-categories contribute most to overall growth?

### Customer Analysis
- Is revenue concentrated among a small group of customers?
- What percentage of total revenue is generated by top customers?

### Customer Churn (Proxy Analysis)
- Are there customers who have stopped purchasing for an extended period?
- Can we identify early churn signals using a time-based churn proxy?

### Operational Insights (Bonus)
- What is the distribution of payment methods across transactions?
- Are certain payment modes associated with higher revenue or profitability?
