## Business Context
This project simulates a **Business Intelligence use case** for an e-commerce company operating across multiple U.S. states and cities.

The company sells products across several product categories and sub-categories (e.g. Electronics, Furniture, Office Supplies) and management requires a clear, executive-level view of:
- revenue trends over time,
- category and customer performance,
- customer concentration risk,
- repeat purchasing behavior.

The goal of the project is to transform raw transactional data into a decision-ready analytical dataset and present key insights through a clean, executive dashboard.

This project is designed as a portfolio case study.

---

## Dataset
The dataset represents **synthetic transactional sales data** and was sourced from:

🔗 https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?src=0&query=sales%20and%20performance&docid=L2cvMTF5d19jcG5yeg%3D%3D

Each record represents a single transaction line, containing:
- order identifiers,
- customer details,
- product category & sub-category,
- geographic attributes,
- order date,
- revenue and profit metrics.

**Important limitations of the dataset:**
- `order_id` is not unique and may appear across different customers and dates.
- The dataset does not contain product-level SKUs.
- The data does not represent a realistic e-commerce order lifecycle.

These limitations required explicit modeling decisions described below.

---

## Business Questions
The dashboard answers the following business-critical questions:

### Revenue & Growth Performance
- How does total revenue evolve over time when viewed at a quarterly level?
- How did revenue perform in the most recent month compared to the previous one?
- Are there clear long-term growth or decline trends?

### Customer Activity
- How does the number of active customers change over time at a quarterly level?
- Is recent revenue driven by broad customer activity or by a small number of customers?

### Product Performance
- Which product sub-categories generate the highest revenue?
- Is revenue diversified across multiple product lines or concentrated in a few categories?

### Customer Value & Concentration
- Is revenue concentrated among a small group of high-value customers?
- What share of total revenue is generated by the top 10% of customers?

### Customer Behavior
- How many customers return for more than one purchase?
- What is the overall repeat purchase rate, and what does it indicate about customer loyalty in a non-subscription retail business?

---

## Data Model
The project follows a **star schema** approach:
- `fact_sales` — transaction-level fact table  
- `dim_date` — calendar dimension  
- `dim_customer` — customer dimension  
- `dim_product_category` — category & sub-category dimension  

To avoid incorrect aggregations:
- A synthetic transaction identifier was introduced to guarantee transaction-level granularity.
- Joins were carefully controlled to avoid fan-out effects.

An analytical export view (`export_sales`) was created for BI consumption.

---

## Data Issues & Fixes (Key Learning)

### Fan-out Join & Revenue Inflation
During development, a critical modeling issue was identified.

An early attempt to enrich the fact table using non-unique joins resulted in duplicated rows and inflated revenue.

**Fix applied:**
- Removed non-unique joins from the fact table  
- Introduced a synthetic `transaction_id`  
- Ensured each transaction appears exactly once in analytical views  

### Non-unique Order IDs
Because `order_id` is reused across customers and dates:
- Order-level metrics are treated as approximations  
- All KPIs are calculated at transaction-level granularity  

---

## KPI Definitions
All KPIs are calculated in **PostgreSQL views** to ensure:
- consistency,
- transparency,
- database-level logic.

### Core KPIs
**Revenue (Last Month)**  
Total revenue in the most recent month available in the data.

**MoM Growth % (Last Month)**  
Percentage revenue change compared to the previous month.

**ARPU (Last Month)**  
Average Revenue Per Active Customer in the most recent month.

**Active Customers (Last Month)**  
Number of customers with at least one transaction in the most recent month.

### Customer Metrics
**Revenue Share – Top 10% Customers**  
Share of total revenue generated by the top revenue decile of customers.

**Repeat Purchase Rate (Overall)**  
Percentage of customers with more than one transaction across the dataset.

---

## Tooling & Constraints
- **SQL Development:** VS Code  
- **Database Management:** pgAdmin (PostgreSQL)  
- **Data Warehouse:** PostgreSQL  
- **Visualization:** Power BI Service (Web)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

Due to working on macOS, Power BI Desktop was not available.
All KPI logic and aggregations were therefore implemented directly in SQL.

---

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of three logical layers:

### Executive Summary
- Revenue (Last Month)  
- MoM Growth %  
- ARPU  
- Repeat Purchase Rate  
- Revenue concentration (Top 10%)  

### Trends & Performance
- Revenue trend over time  
- Active customers trend over time  
- Revenue by sub-category  
- Top customers by revenue  
- Revenue by state

### Insight Layer
- Total Customers  
- Active Customers  

Screenshots are available in the `/visuals` folder.

## Key Insights
- Quarterly revenue trends show long-term growth followed by stabilization, with revenue peaking around 2022 and remaining relatively stable through 2024 before a visible decline in early 2025.
- The most recent month shows a sharp short-term decline, with revenue at $52K and a −38.38% month-over-month drop, signaling a potential slowdown that warrants monitoring.
- Recent revenue is driven by very few customers, with only 6 active customers in the last month and a high ARPU of $8.7K, indicating reliance on a small number of high-value transactions rather than broad demand.
- Revenue concentration is moderate, with the top 10% of customers generating 25.3% of total revenue, suggesting some dependency on key accounts but not extreme concentration risk.
- Repeat Purchase Rate stands at 37.16%, which is typical for non-subscription retail and electronics businesses, where most customers make occasional rather than recurring purchases.
- Revenue is well diversified across product sub-categories, with Markers, Tables, Sofas, and Printers leading sales, reducing dependency on a single product line.
- Geographic performance is balanced, with New York, Florida, and California leading in revenue but no single state dominating, lowering regional risk.
